# API_Script

In order to upload a file in to the user panel(without redirectig to the frontend) applying API requests, the required steps would be:
1. Create a new basket
2. Save the basket Id
3. Create a new line in our basket
4. Save the Line Id
5. Upload the 3d file to the created basket

The 3D file should be in the same directory as the python script.
By running the script the file will be uploaded to the created basket, which can be visible also in the User Panel.
